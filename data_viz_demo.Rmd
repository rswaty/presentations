# THANK YOU



---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Success:
## You walk away thinking "yeah-I should keep my R skills honed!"
## You think about using R in a new way
## We do something good with these skills

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# My plan

## Ask you some questions :)
## Tell you a little about my work, and how I got into this R maddness
## Showcase some examples and tell a few stories

*And answer questions from you! Please ask away!*

# Those questions
## Are you math majors?  Ecology/biology?  Econonmics/business?  Something different entirely?
## I'm guessing you have ggplot/tidyverse memorized?  How about ggvis?  Highcharter? Crosstalk? Shiny?
## Are you using R in your other classes?  Maybe in non-data viz ways?

# Why did I start learning R?

I had a problem.

# Why did I start learning R?

Reproducibility: that confusing .csv file

# Next

I started folding R into as many things as possible.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/list.JPG")

# Strategies

## Ask yourself "how do I learn best?" <br>
## Ask yourself "what do I really do?  How can I fold coding into that?" <br>
## Organize---my data viz project

*If it's not hard you probably aren't learning*

# Keep learning!


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="40%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/finnJumps.jpg")

# Keep learning!

## Blogs such as R-Bloggers and R-Weekly
## Google your favorite topics--there's data or a package for that!
## Tidy Tuesdays
## Twitter
