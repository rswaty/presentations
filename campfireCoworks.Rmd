# Success equals:
## You start learning to code--or if you code you try something new
## You think about learning in a different way
## We do something good with these skills

# What is R?

"R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It compiles and runs on a wide variety of UNIX platforms, Windows and MacOS. To download R, please choose your preferred CRAN mirror.

If you have questions about R like how to download and install the software, or what the license terms are, please read our answers to frequently asked questions before you send an email."

**PLEASE forget all of that**

# How did I start learning R?

I had a problem.

# Next

I started folding R into as many things as possible.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/list.JPG")
```

# Strategies

Ask yourself "how do I learn best?" <br>
Find a friend or a friend analog <br>
Ask yourself "what do I really do?  How can I fold coding into that?" <br>

*If it's not hard you probably aren't learning*

# Call to action: Do good with your skills


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="40%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/finnJumps.jpg")
```

*Consider learning, teaching, mentoring in the Conservation Data Lab*
