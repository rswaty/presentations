# What I do at work

### Get call to assess large landscape = good day
### Mostly e-mails = bad day
### Idea creation = great day
### Someone blames me for something terrible = bad day

<br>

*I do little field work, but have amazing flexibility, and a great community*

### Click and explore the report from one national forest
### Be skeptical (I'll share a reason why).  Come up with 3 questions for me.  Write them down.
### Prepare to discuss.  I just might call on you.
