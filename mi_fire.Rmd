knitr::include_graphics("images/vdep.jpg")
```


* Look at historical fire regimes
* Explore today's fire exposure, science and action 
* Discuss next steps

* MI DNR burned ~ 6,022ac in 2022 (73 burns).
* ~3,500ac of wildfire in 2022 (376 fires; National Interagency Coordination Center)
* Ottawa averaged ~80ac, Hiawatha ~165 and Huron-Manistee 3,686 over the last 3 years
* Ottawa NF has ~350ac planned, Hiawatha NF ~9,000k ac for 2024
* Did not obtain USFWS plans; found Sleeping Bear has ~1,100ac planned for 2024

# More on the need

<br>
<br>

* There is not a comprehensive, current fire needs assessment.  
* Climate change is not factored into these assessments (to my knowledge).  
* For some goals and situations harvests should be factored in.  
* "Need" may be defined very broadly, from structure-focused fuels reduction to forward-looking resiliency.
* Additionally-there *could be* carbon-biodiversity-'other' conflicts and situations to assess moving forward.

# What I am doing

* Keeping up relationships with Hiawatha, Ottawa, USFS Region 9 fire staff
    * Providing maps, charts and summaries as asked
    * Attending meetings and field trips
    * Proposing NMU summer course on fire and monitoring (field and remote)
* Growing relationships with Jill Pritchett and Sienna Falzetta, ecologists with the Huron-Manistee NF
* Across the Midwest I play well with WIBU and MNBU staff including Ann Calhoun, Hannah Spaul, Laura Slavsky, Chris Dunham, Marissa Ahlering
* Trying to update historical ecosystem models when new info comes along
* Connecting dots
