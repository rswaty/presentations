# Goals

<br>
<br>


**Look at historical fire regimes (broadly)**

**Explore today's fire exposure, science and action**

**Discuss Living with Fire Strategy**

# More on recent fires

<br>
<br>

* MI DNR burned ~ 6,022ac in 2022 (73 burns).
* National Interagency Coordination Center reported ~ 3,500ac of wildfires in 2022 (376 fires)
* Largest fire in the FOD was the Duck Lake fire at ~23k ac
* Ottawa NF has ~350ac planned, Hiawatha NF ~9,000k ac, Huron-Manistee NF 
* Did not obtain USFWS plans; found Sleeping Bear has ~1,100ac planned for 2024 it appears
* MIBU-TNC burned 67 and 164ac in 2022 and 2023 respectfully

# More on the need

<br>
<br>

* There is not a comprehensive, current fire needs assessment.  Assessments typically report staggeringly high numbers.
* Climate change is not factored into these assessments (to my knowledge).  There are other climate-relevant resources that may factor fire in (e.g., NIACS vulnerability assessments).
* For some goals and situations harvests should be factored in.  
* "Need" may be defined very broadly, from structure-focused fuels reduction to forward-looking resiliency.
* Additionally-there *could be* carbon-biodiversity-'other' conflicts and situations to assess moving forward.
