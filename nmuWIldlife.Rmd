# Take class project opportunities/Capstones seriously

## Push the thinking a bit--can you partner with a colleague and get more done?
## Can you work with a dream future employer?  For example Andrea Denham of the Upper Peninsula Land Conservancy?
## Take stock of what you know, and need to know.  How can you fill the gaps?
