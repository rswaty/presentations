# My plan for the day
## Introductions: How do you eat a muffin? and here would you take me in your home town (you are more than your career) ?
## Kick off some code and hope it works
## Discuss my title "Ecologist for The Nature Conservancy's LANDFIRE team"
## See how that code did, demo what I do next in QGIS and GitHub
## Tour a western dry forest project
